### üõë Blocking Issues
1.  **File:** `script.js:101`
    **Issue:** The `catch` block in the `fetchIssues` function only logs API errors to the console. If the GitHub API call fails (e.g., due to rate limiting or network issues), the game will not start, and the user is left on a blank screen with no explanation.
    **Fix:** Display a user-friendly error message in the UI. For instance, you could show the error in the `game-area` and provide a button to try again.

### üëç Recommended Improvements
1.  **File:** `script.js:41`
    **Suggestion:** The restart button forces a full page reload via `location.reload()`. A more seamless user experience would be to implement a `resetGame()` function that resets the game state (score, lives, issues) and restarts the game logic without requiring a refresh.
2.  **File:** `script.js:190`
    **Suggestion:** The `handleDrop` function includes comments like `// Add visual feedback for correct drop`. Implementing this feedback, such as a brief color flash on the bin or a score change animation, would make the game feel more responsive and engaging.
3.  **File:** `script.js:170`
    **Suggestion:** Updating an element's position by repeatedly reading from the DOM with `parseInt(issueEl.style.top)` can be brittle. It's more robust to store the position in the element's associated JavaScript object and use that as the source of truth, only updating the `style` property for rendering.
4.  **File:** `script.js`
    **Suggestion:** The code uses several "magic numbers" for game mechanics (e.g., `16` for the interval, `2` for falling speed, `2000` for spawn delay). Defining these as named constants at the top of the file would improve readability and make the game's parameters easier to adjust.

### ‚úÖ Summary
Looks good to merge after addressing the blocking API error handling issue.
