### Overall Assessment & Net Improvement
This is a fantastic and creative pull request that completely transforms the application from a simple issue list into a fun, interactive issue-sorting game. This is a huge net improvement that dramatically increases user engagement. The code is generally well-structured, the UI is polished and modern, and the core functionality is clever and well-implemented.

While the change is excellent, there are some areas that need attention to meet production standards, primarily concerning error handling, code completeness, and the addition of tests.

### Mandatory Changes
- **File:** `script.js:101` - The `catch` block for `fetchIssues` only logs to the console. It should display an error message to the user in the UI so they know why the game isn't starting. The current comment `// Handle error in UI` indicates this is an unimplemented feature.
- **File:** `script.js:213` & `script.js:216` - The comments `// Add visual feedback for correct drop` and `// Add visual feedback for incorrect drop` are placeholders for unimplemented functionality. This feedback is important for good gameplay and should be implemented.
- **File:** `script.js:228` - The `loseLife` function should also include visual feedback (e.g., flashing the screen red) to ensure the player notices when they lose a life. The placeholder comment `// Add visual feedback for losing a life` should be addressed.
- **File:** `style.css:140` - The `@keyframes fadeOut` is defined but never used in the stylesheet. Unused code should be removed.
- **General:** A change of this magnitude, which introduces significant new logic, requires tests. Please add unit tests for the pure logic functions (e.g., `getIssueCategory`) and consider adding a basic end-to-end test to verify the core game loop and user interaction.

### Optional Suggestions & Nits
- **File:** `index.html:46` - The `end-screen` element uses an inline style (`style="display: none;"`). It's better practice to control visibility with a CSS class (e.g., `.hidden`) to keep styling separate from the HTML structure.
- **File:** `script.js:36` - Restarting the game with `location.reload()` is effective but inefficient, as it requires the browser to re-download and re-parse all assets. A more elegant solution would be to create a `resetGame()` function that resets all state variables (`score`, `lives`, `issueQueue`, etc.) and restarts the game logic without a full page refresh.
- **File:** `script.js:13-19` - There are many global variables for game state. Consider encapsulating them within a single `gameState` object. This would improve organization, make the state easier to manage and reset, and reduce the risk of polluting the global namespace.
- **File:** `script.js:235` - Using `'❤️'.repeat(lives)` is a clever shortcut, but it can have inconsistent rendering across different browsers and platforms. A more robust approach would be to create and manage individual `<span>` elements for each life, which would also allow for more complex animations (like a heart breaking).

### Positive Feedback
- This is a highly creative and engaging feature. Turning issue triage into a game is a brilliant idea and makes for a much more compelling demonstration.
- The visual design and CSS are excellent. The use of a grid layout, CSS variables for theming, and smooth animations creates a very polished and professional-looking UI.
- The JavaScript is well-organized into functions with clear, single responsibilities (e.g., `spawnIssue`, `handleDrop`, `updateGame`), which makes the code easy to read and understand.
- The "bonus clue" feature is a thoughtful addition that improves the gameplay and helps guide the user.
- The code is clean and follows a consistent style, making it easy to review.
