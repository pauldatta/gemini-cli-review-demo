# Gemini-CLI Issue Tracker

This is a simple, fun, and creative front-end web application that displays the open issues from the [google-gemini/gemini-cli](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) GitHub repository.

## Experiment: Gemini CLI for Code Review

This repository is also an experiment to test the capabilities of the `gemini-cli` as an automated code review agent. A GitHub Actions workflow is set up to review pull requests using the Gemini CLI and post the feedback as a comment.

## How to View

Since this is a completely front-end application, you can open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser to see it in action.

Alternatively, you can host it on a static web hosting service like GitHub Pages.
